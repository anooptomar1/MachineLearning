# Machine Learning
This project is to be used for the machine learning workshop. The project in the main branch is the start point.

The application will combine NLP, using a model in Core ML and using the Vision framework. The goal is to use the framework that Apple provides for machine learning and to see how they work together.

The model used for sentiment analysis is called SentimentPolarity and was taken from [here](https://github.com/SwiftBrain/awesome-CoreML-models).

The model for the emotion recognition is VisualSentimentCNN and was taken from [here](https://github.com/SwiftBrain/awesome-CoreML-models).
